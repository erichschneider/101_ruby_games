101 Ruby Games
==============

This is a collection of Ruby ports of the BASIC program in David M. Ahl's
classic book *101 BASIC Computer Games*. My aim is to replicate the original
algorithms and output of the BASIC originals, but programmed in Ruby. So,
you'll see that the input text is all uppercase and often formatted for a 
40-column display, just like we had on our microcomputers in the '70s and '80s.
When motivated to do so, I'll also refactor the games to make them more concise
and understandable. The games are designed to be run from the command line,
so they have hash-bang initial lines and this isn't organized in the usual Rails way.

I started using computers in 1980 in my 4th grade classroom, which
had gotten an Apple II+ as part of an Apple education program. I learned BASIC
from one of my father's old textbooks and started programming it. Eventually 
my parents bought the family an Apple //e (after an interlude with a TI-99/4A), 
and I was given a copy of Ahl's book as a Christmas gift. I typed in and 
played a number of the games, most notably "Super Star Trek".

In July of 2013 I started work as a Ruby programmer. My first job as a Ruby 
programmer, in fact. Also in July of 2013, I took a trip one Saturday to the
Computer History Museum in Mountain View, which was a big trip down memory lane 
for me. The experience got me thinking back to my days as a BASIC programmer
and Ahl's book, and I thought, "why not get some extra experience with Ruby by
translating those games into Ruby?"

Fortunately for me, the book is online at this location:
