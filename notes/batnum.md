Not much to say about this game. As the original text states, there is an optimal strategy, which the computer attempts to implement. The fact that Ruby has a modulo function made the one decision function more straightforward to represent, and I found a clever use of `sort` on a three-element list to clamp values between a minimum and maximum.
