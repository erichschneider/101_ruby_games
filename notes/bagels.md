Bagels
------

A pretty simple program. Most of the verbiage is in the I/O and insuring
that user inputs are correct - the actual logic of determining the number
of "picos" and "fermis" (or "bagels") and printing them takes three lines
of Ruby, as opposed to 30 lines of BASIC.

Note that this game is a variant of the board game Mastermind, which is
itself one of the 101 games (although that implementation also puts the
computer in the guessing role).
